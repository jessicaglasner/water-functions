## Description

This python modual containts functions for the calculation of thermophysical properties of moist air in the range between 0 and 100 &deg;C. For details regarding these functions see P.T. Tsilingiris (2008) “Thermophsical and transport properties of humid air at temperature range between 0 and 100 &deg;C,” *Energy Conv. Manag.* (49) pp. 1098–1110.

## Error in Tsilingiris

[Back to Table of Contents] (README.md#table-of-contents)

It is important to note that there is an error in Equation (6) of Tsilingiris (2008). The second to last term in the equation should be P<sub>0</sub>/P<sub>sv</sub> rather than P<sub>sv</sub>/P<sub>0</sub>. Theis error was also propigated to the values of the enhancement factor in Table 1. I submitted a corrigendum in December 2016 to *Energy Conv. Manag.*, however, at the time of writing it was not available online or linked to the manuscript.
